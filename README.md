# DSP_HW2-1

* This work constructs a digit recognizer with Hidden Markov Toolkit (HTK), a free tool for Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

* Several parameters can be tuned for better accuracy, e.g. # of states, # of Gaussian mixture, and # of iterations.

### Usage

* Create a folder named “result”.

* ./autorun2.sh

* For more details, please refer to the file dsp_hw2-1.pdf.
